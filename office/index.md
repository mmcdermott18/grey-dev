GREY is dedicated to crafting unique and inspiring spaces across a range of scales—from smaller exhibitions and custom furniture to single-family residences and retail spaces. The studio is consistently seeking new challenges and creative opportunities nationwide. 

We believe architecture is a thoughtful response to its unique site, the client's lifestyle, and the surrounding cultural context. Our research-driven process, combined with engaging client dialogue and meticulous attention to detail, leads to unexpected design solutions that inspire curiosity and elevate the everyday experience.

#### Garrett Reynolds, AIA, LEED AP
##### Principal Architect / Founder

Garrett spends his time with one foot in the city and one in nature, consistently drawing inspiration from both to inform his work. He’s drawn to the subtle details—material choices, craft, and local character—that give a place its identity. With this foundation, he approaches each project as a response to its context, designing architecture that feels rooted, intentional, and quietly transformative. 

Garrett is a licensed architect in Washington and California and a LEED-accredited professional. He earned his Bachelor of Architecture degree from Virginia Tech, graduating with distinction and receiving the AIA Henry Adams Medal. He is the recipient of AIA Seattle’s Emerging Professionals Scholarship, AIA Seattle’s Young Architects Award, and the Donald and Joanna Sunshine Alumni Award.

Before founding GREY, Garrett gained experience at several acclaimed firms including Olson Kundig and Bohlin Cywinski Jackson in Seattle, and EM2N in Zürich, Switzerland. His project experience spans a diverse range—from a sustainable treehouse in rural West Virginia to an urban mixed-use development in Portland, Oregon, to a large family retreat on California's rugged coastline, alongside numerous custom residential projects both nationally and internationally.

At GREY, Garrett has developed a practice that balances technical rigor with design expression, crafting innovative yet conceptually clear solutions through close collaboration with clients, consultants, and craftspeople. This collaborative approach creates architecture that emerges from careful attention to place, program, and the subtle character of each site.
