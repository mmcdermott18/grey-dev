The office works on projects across a range of scales—from smaller exhibitions and custom furniture to single-family residences and complex mixed-use developments—consistently seeking new and creative opportunities.

GREY is dedicated to crafting unique and inspiring spaces. We believe architecture should be a thoughtful response to its unique site, the client's needs, and the surrounding cultural context. Our research-driven process, combined with engaging client dialogue and meticulous attention to detail, leads to unexpected design solutions that inspire curiosity and elevate the everyday experience.
